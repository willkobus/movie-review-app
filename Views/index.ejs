              <h2>Ninja Turtles</h2>
              <p>
                In New York, mysterious radioactive ooze has mutated four sewer
                turtles into talking, upright-walking, crime-fighting ninjas.
                The intrepid heroes -- Michelangelo, Donatello
                , Raphael and Leonardo 
                -- are trained in the Ninjutsu arts by their rat sensei,
                Splinter. When a villainous rogue ninja, who is a former pupil
                of Splinter, arrives and spreads lawlessness throughout the
                city, it's up to the plucky turtles to stop him.
